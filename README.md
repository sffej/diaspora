With Diaspora you can:

- Make cool stuff
- Share it across the web
- Own your own data


## Quick Start:

Here's how you can get a **[development](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)** environment up and running.  This is where any new pod runner should start, as well as people
looking to contribute to D*.  This script assumes you have [a basic Rails setup installed](http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html).

### Step 1: Run the script and follow the on screen instructions.
```bash
  bash <(curl https://raw.github.com/diaspora/diaspora/master/script/install.sh)
```


### Step 2: Run the development server
```bash
  rails s
```

then visit 'http://localhost:3000' in your browser.

### Step 3 (for developers): Run tests
```bash
  rake
```

### Step 4 (for everyone): Party.


### Want a production setup? Having trouble with install script? Want to install D* the slow way?
  Look to more specific install guides [here](http://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Installation_guides).
